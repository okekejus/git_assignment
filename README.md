# Git Assignment - <okekejus>
1. **What is an issue?**  A tracking system available within all repositories used for planning and discussing work.
2. **What is a pull request?**   A proposal to merge changes from one branch/fork into another.
3. **Describe the steps to open a pull request?**
   - Create a new repository, or fork an existing one. This can be done on Github directly or using the terminal.
   - Using github, Navigate to the top of your project, in the tool  bar below username/project_name locate the second option "Pull request", select "Create new pull request"
4. **Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)**
   - Within the same toolbar described above, locate "settings", click on it. In the toolbar to the top left of the resulting page, select   
  "collaborators".
   - You will be asked to enter/use your passkey before proceeding. Then you will be able to make the necessary changes to 
  include a collaborator.
5. **What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?** Git is free and open source, it allows users to conduct version control locally. Github is built on Git, and is set up to manage version control on a cloud platform. Allows for wider/easier collabroration than just Git alone. There are free and paid versions of Github.
6. **What does `git diff` do?** Allows for viewing changes that have been made to a branch of a specific repository.
7. **What is the `main` branch?** The default branch within a repository. Also the one that is checked first when the repository is cloned.
8. **Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?** My understanding is that you compare the main branch to your new branch in order for people to see the changes and approve them first.
